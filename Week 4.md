To reduce the risk of electric shock, this plug will fit in a polarized outlet only one way. If the plug does not fit fully into the outlet, reverse the plug. If it still does not fit, contact a qualified electrician. Do not modify the plug in any way.
**NOTES ON THE CORD** The provided short power-supply cord (or detachable power-supply cord) should be used to reduce the risk resulting from becoming entangled in or tripping over a longer cord. An extension cord is not recommended for use with this product. Always plug directly into a wall outlet/receptacle
**PLASTICIZER WARNING CAUTION:** To prevent Plasticizers from migrating to the finish of the counter top or table top or other furniture, place NON-PLASTIC coasters or place mats between the appliance and the finish of the counter top or table top. Failure to do so may cause the finish to darken; permanent blemishes may occur or stains can appear.
**ELECTRIC POWER** If the electrical circuit is overloaded with other appliances, your appliance may not operate properly. It should be operated on a separate electrical circuit from other appliances.
